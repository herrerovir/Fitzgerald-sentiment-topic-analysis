In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.,0.091,0.909,0.0,-0.2944

"Most of the confidences were unsoughtfrequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions.",0.048,0.952,0.0,-0.3818
Reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope.,0.0,0.556,0.444,0.4588

When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart.,0.056,0.87,0.074,0.1779

"This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the ""creative temperament""it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again.",0.0,0.712,0.288,0.9393

"The Carraways are something of a clan, and we have a tradition that we're descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather's brother, who came here in fiftyone, sent a substitute to the Civil War, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today.",0.095,0.905,0.0,-0.7469
